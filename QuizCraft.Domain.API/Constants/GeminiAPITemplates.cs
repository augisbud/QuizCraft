        I will also provide a sample json structure in which to return the questions themselves and the four possible answers for each question.
        Come up with a title, then provide the category enum for one of the following: GeneralKnowledge,    Science,    History,    Geography,    Sports,    Entertainment,    Technology,    Mathematics,    Literature,    Music,    Art,    Movies,    Politics,    Language,    Religion,    FoodAndDrink,    Nature,    Health,    Business,    Travel.
        You need to specify using a boolean, which question is correct and which are incorrect.
        Randomize the order of correct and incorrect questions, meaning that the correct answer should not always be the first answer.
        Respond with a that json structure and that json structure only, only fill in the provided properties, do not add ```json or any other properties.
        The expected output structure is: {JsonConvert.SerializeObject(ExampleQuestion)}";
